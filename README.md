## What is PCCHR?

PCCHR is an OpenMRS module that allows patients to login to the system and enter self-monitored healthcare data. Patients can give access to their circle of care. Clinicians can login and view their patient data just like any other EMR. The main repository for the HL10-PCCHR (Patient Controlled and Contributed Health Record) [is here](https://github.com/E-Health/openmrs-module-patientportaltoolkit-pcchr)

PCCHR has a uniform data model for all health data that would allow devices such as mobile phones and sensors to feed data as well. The reference implementation has a PhoneGap application that can be used to send data. This is a UWP (Univeral Windows Platform) App to leverage Cortana for elderly patients to enter self-monitored health data through voice commands.

PCCHR is an open-source project and needs your help to reach our goal. Experience in OpenMRS platform, ReactJS, d3js, hGraph.js, PhoneGap or Windows Universal App programming would be useful. Even if you are not a programmer, you can help us with testing and documentation.

## What is the motivation and what is HL10?

HL10 stands for Hamilton, a city in Ontario, Canada. HL10 is a conceptual framework for mHealth Behaviour Intervention Technology. [Read More..](http://nuchange.ca/2015/10/hl10-what-is-it.html)


This module would extend the concept of Patient-Controlled Health Record (PCHR) to **Patient-Controlled and Contributed Health Record (PCCHR)** with the simple and unique HL10 data model for Behaviour Intervention Technology.
